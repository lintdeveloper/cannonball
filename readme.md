Cannonball is a Location-based check-in application that can automatically export event attendees to a Slack Team. 

The idea behind our mobile application is to create the easiest platform for taking class or student organization attendance. Users can see events that are occuring in their area, and check in to those events easily. After the meeting is over, the organizer can send out an invitation to attendees, asking them to join a Slack channel.

We built this app using:
* Flutter - Mobile app framework - [docs](https://flutter.io/)
* Flask - API - [docs](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/)
* Google App Engine - API Host - [docs](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/)

* Google Maps API - Location Services - [docs](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/intro)
